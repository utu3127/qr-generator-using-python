I developed a Python program that generates QR codes for YouTube song links. By inputting a song's URL into the code, it creates a QR code that can be scanned to directly open the song on YouTube. This simplifies the process, making it convenient for users to access songs without manually searching for them. The project is designed to enhance ease of use and quick access to music.
